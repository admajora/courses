# The Prototype Pattern

## Pros

- Leverage JavaScript's built-int features
- "Modularize" code into re-usable objects
- Variables/functions taken out of global namespace
- Functions loaded into memory once
- Possible to "override" functions through prototyping

## Cons

- `this` can be tricky
- Constructor separate from prototype definition
